This project is a way for me to practice with classes in Java.

## Methods
Here, I've built a simple calculator using the Calculator class. It has the following methods:

- add() - accepts two integer values and returns their sum
- sub() - accepts two integer values and returns their difference 
- mult() - accepts two integer values and returns their product
- div() - accepts two integer values and returns their quotient
- mod() - accepts two integer values and returns their remainder (modulus operator) 

** Note: I decided that the type for each method should accept and return type double to give the user more flexibility in what they can enter as input. The only exception is with the modulo operator as it can only return an int type.

## Future Improvements
These are the features I'd like to add in the future:
- How to accept user input/ accept input from the command line
- Error handling for incorrect input 
- Integrate UI with this project

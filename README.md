This project is a way for me to practice with classes in Java.

Here, I've built a simple calculator using the Calculator class. It has the following methods:
-- add() - accepts two integer values and returns their sum
-- sub() - accepts two integer values and returns their difference 
-- mult() - accepts two integer values and returns their product
-- div() - accepts two integer values and returns their quotient
-- mod() - accepts two integer values and returns their remainder (modulus operator)
